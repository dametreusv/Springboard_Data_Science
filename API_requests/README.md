In this exercise we will be pulling some data from the Quandl API. Qaundl is currently the most widely used aggregator of financial market data.
We will focus on equities data from the Frankfurt Stock Exhange (FSE), which is available for free. We'll try and analyze the stock prices of a company called Carl Zeiss Meditec, which manufactures tools for eye examinations, as well as medical lasers for laser eye surgery. The company is listed under the stock ticker AFX_X.
